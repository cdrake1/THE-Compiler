# THE-Compiler

THECompiler is a Java-based compiler built from [this](https://www.labouseur.com/commondocs/6502alan-instruction-set.pdf) 6502 microprocessor instruction set. This compiler build will be separated into four sections denoted by Project 1, Project 2, and so on. If you are unsure exactly what a compiler is, a brief definition from the [dragon textbook](https://www.amazon.com/Compilers-Principles-Techniques-Tools-Edition/dp/0321486811) describes it as "a program that can read a program in one lanÂ­guage, the source language and translate it into an equivalent program in another language, the target language." Like a standard compiler, this compiler will contain both a front and back end. The front end will contain the lexer, parser, and semantic analysis to translate the high-level input code into an intermediate representation, which for us will be an abstract syntax tree. Our back end, however, will translate our intermediate representation into 6502 machine instruction!

# Sections
- Project 1
- Project 2
- Project 3
- Project 4

# What's Needed?
To create an environment for THECompiler we will need the following:

1. A working version of Java. If you need help installing or updating it, look at this [link](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/download_options.html).
2. A sufficient IDE....that WORKS! I prefer using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).

# Building and Running
  - Navigate to the src folder within THECompiler and compile the Java source code into byte code using the command: "javac THECompiler.java"
  - This should create another file or update the current file, named: "THECompiler.class".
  - To run the compiled code you can use: "java THECompiler.class" or if you would like to use a parameter: "java THECompiler.class example.txt"
