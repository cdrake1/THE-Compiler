# THE-Compiler

THECompiler is a Java compiler built off of [this](https://www.labouseur.com/commondocs/6502alan-instruction-set.pdf) 6502 microprocessor instruction set. This compiler build will be separated into four sections denoted by Project 1, Project 2, and so on.

# Sections
- Project 1
- Project 2
- Project 3
- Project 4

# What's Needed?
To create an environment for THECompiler we will need the following:

1. Make sure you are running a working version of Java. If you need help installing or updating it, look at this [link](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/download_options.html).
2. A sufficient IDE. That WORKS! I prefer using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).

# Building and Running
  - Navigate to the src folder within THECompiler and compile the Java source code into byte code using the command: "javac THECompiler.java"
  - This should create another file or update the current file, named: "THECompiler.class".
