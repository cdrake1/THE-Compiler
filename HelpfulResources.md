# Resources and References
This is a file that contains the resources I have used to create simple, readable, and beautiful code. 
Each reference will be listed below along with where it was used and how it helped me.

- This resource helped me determine how to receive input from the command line. [geeksforgeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/command-line-arguments-in-java/)
- This website assisted me by providing access to resources such as slides, textbooks, and snippits of code. I utilized some of the code listed under "AlanC, a simple lexer via JavaCC" to help structure my lexer. [labouseur.com]https://www.labouseur.com/courses/compilers/
